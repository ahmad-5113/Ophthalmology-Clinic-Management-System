# Ophthalmology Clinic Management System

The **Ophthalmology Clinic Management System** is a database-driven application designed to enhance the efficiency of operations within an eye clinic. The system is built for two key stakeholders: **Ophthalmologists** and **Patients**.  

- **Ophthalmologists** can use the platform to manage appointments, maintain patient records, track treatment history, and issue prescriptions.  
- **Patients** can register, manage their accounts, book appointments, view their medical history, and provide feedback.  

The goal of this project is to create a digital solution that ensures organized data management, seamless communication, and convenient access to healthcare services.
